# C-to-Python-Code-Transpiler
Built a CLI tool to automatically convert  C code into clean, readable Python. Parsed C into an AST, translated core constructs (loops, conditionals,  functions), and handled type inference using Python and pycparser. Helpful in modernizing legacy C  codebases for students and developers.
